## Locking

Liquidity launched and locked with Aero Launch will display on the dashboard
like any other deposit.

Locked deposits allow for additional liquidity to be added, but do not allow
changes to the price range or withdrawals.

Locked deposits can be staked and unstaked if staking rewards are available.

Locked deposits allow a share of the accrued fees or rewards to be used for
incentives. The owner of the deposit will see an option to incentivize with
these from their dashboard. These incentives can be added only to the liquidity
pool where the fees or rewards come from.

Once the expiration date is reached, the deposit can be unlocked by the owner
and managed just like a regular deposit.

## Emerging Liquidity

New launches may appear as "emerging." This highlight is discretionary and helps
differentiate these launches from other pools and tokens.

Emerging tokens will display differently with a unique indicator for those who swap, vote and generally
across the liquidity screens.

Emerging tokens can graduate seamlessly to receive staking rewards without any
additional migration.

Graduation to staking rewards does not unlock or change
any underlying deposits.

<div id="fees"></div>

## Fees

Aero Launch charges no fees and is completely permissionless.

Other products launching and locking liquidity on behalf of an deposit owner
can designate a referral/beneficiary to receive a share of fees or staking
rewards.

The fees or staking rewards can be claimed any time as soon as they accrue.
If there's a referral/beneficiary share set, the fees or staking rewards will be calculated and
redirected at claim time automatically.
